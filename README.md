# Employee Attrition Prediction Model
This project aims to predict employee attrition using advanced unsupervised learning techniques and data analysis to provide insights for proactive retention strategies.
## Overview
Employee attrition is a critical challenge for organizations. This project utilizes machine learning to analyze HR data and predict potential attrition risks, enabling organizations to take proactive measures.


## Key Techniques
1. Clustering Techniques: K-means clustering, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
2. Outlier Detection: Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Isolation Forest
3. Dimensionality Reduction: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
## Objective
Identify factors contributing to employee attrition. Predict potential attrition risks using unsupervised learning. Provide actionable insights for organizations to develop retention strategies
## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, Encoding categorical variables, Splitting data for training and testing
2. Analysis Techniques: Elbow Method for optimal cluster determination, Clustering with K-means and GMM, Outlier detection with LOF and Isolation Forest, Dimensionality reduction using PCA and t-SNE
## Findings
1. Determined optimal clusters using the Elbow Method
2. Clustered employees using K-means and GMM
3. Detected outliers using LOF and Isolation Forest
4. Achieved an 85% accuracy in predicting employee attrition
## Compiling
1. Install Streamlit: 
cmd: pip install streamlit

2. Run the App:
In your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the file '.py'
cmd: streamlit run project_source_code.py

## Conclusion
This project showcases the potential of machine learning in identifying patterns and risks related to employee attrition. Leveraging unsupervised learning techniques, organizations can proactively address attrition factors, enhance retention strategies, and maintain a more engaged workforce.
